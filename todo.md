[] Add input validations for API option (currently there's only CLI input validation)
[] Add a proper error to throw at src\controllers\create\customType\index.ts
[] Add validation for DB schema creation

[] Make sure selecting "none" for choosing required props works.
Urgent: [] add the option to edit the db schema creation when creating an interface.
